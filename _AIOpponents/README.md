# _AIOpponents
A mod for Your Only Move Is Hustle that can control and play any character against you! 

### REQUIRES MOD OPTIONS TO CHANGE DIFFICULTIES AND TURN ON/OFF.

In your Mod Options, you will find "AI Opponent Options". Set it to control a player and select a difficulty.

You can select its moves to look at its predictions, but ultimately, it locks in its own move and DI.

On Easy and Medium, it looks one step ahead - it'll look at the moves you can make (to a limited extent) and respond accordingly.
It's (still) not good at comboing, but it'll try its best!


## Currently known incompatibilities:
- Sticky DI Fixer

If you find any more incompatibilities, please let me know.


## Short FAQ:

- Do I need to turn P2 input off?
No, and I would advise against it. You want to be able to check what options your opponent can use, after all!

- My game isn't responding after I press lock in. Has the game crashed?
No, just let it think. Especially on Hard Mode, it can be taxing on your computer's resources.

- What if an AI could be a boss character or do other things?
I'm also planning to make a library to aid creation of specific AIs for bosses or special characters that wouldn't fit a general purpose AI playstyle. If you want the AI to be any more difficult to beat, this is how it will happen. Stay tuned!

- Why can't I choose my move at the same time as the AI? It's taking ages and makes my game slow. And why does it take so long? Can't it think faster?
I've been trying to fix both of those issues for a very long time. For many reasons, the former is basically impossible and the latter is extremely difficult.
For a more in-depth explanation of this, I've written about it in the AI's release thread on Discord.


There's much to be improved about this mod, so I'd appreciate your feedback and ideas.
## Features that will exist:
- Better aiming
- Better flip-moves
- Having two AIs at once (Currently works, but I'd like to optimise it)
Features that I'd like to exist, but may have to be exclusive to the library:
- Faster predictions
- Using Extra Data
